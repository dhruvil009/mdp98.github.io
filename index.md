# About Me

## A quick insight :mag:
Hey! My name is Meet Parikh and I am a pre-final year student pursuing B.E.(Hons) in **Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering** at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, well known as **BITS Pilani**.
Exploring the vast boundless realms of Computer Science has imbibed in me an interest, a need to know more and create more, something which a combination of transistors and resistors could never do. It's fascinating what we can achieve with loads of data and I aim to harness this power that rests in our hands to make our lives easier. And as I always keep on telling myself, I believe that I am : 'In the process of making a difference!'

## Interests :book:
Initial sparks of my interest in Computer Science occurred when I first came to know about Apple's Siri and Jarvis from Ironman. I was fascinated by the fact that such systems can be developed which can understand human voice. After that, whatever fascinating program I came across, I would wonder what all technologies might have been used to give that program it's features. I love to challenge my boundaries of understanding of this beautiful subject and wish to keep on doing it tirelessly. My interests mainly lie in the fields of **Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things**.

## The Rest of Me :v:
When not exercising my grey cells, I listen to music, read crime-fiction novels, sketch, paint, play cricket and badminton. I am a TV series buff and I like sci-fi, brainy movies. That's pretty much it!
